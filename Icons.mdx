### 1. Motion States

#### **Hover (Web Only)**

- **Purpose**: Signal interactivity and encourage exploration.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Container fill** gently fades in (light brand tint or gray)
  - **Outline** appears or lightly pulses
  - Optional: **Icon scale-up** to 1.05× for tactile feel
- **Duration**: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User (pointer interaction)
- **Notes**:
  - Use the **scale hover** pattern for icons with defined containers
  - Do not shift the layout or nudge the surrounding elements

---

#### **Focus (Keyboard / Mobile)**

- **Purpose**: Improve accessibility by highlighting navigational focus.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Outline pulse** or glow ring expansion
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User (tab, directional nav, screen reader focus)
- **Notes**:
  - Ensure visual distinction even under reduced motion
  - Avoid combining with hover effects unless a fallback is managed

---

#### **Active (Click / Tap)**

- **Purpose**: Acknowledge the moment of action.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Mouse-aware fill ripple** emanates from the interaction point
  - Optional **border swirl** or animated stroke ring
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**:
  - **Press-in**: `ease-in-quad`
  - **Release-out**: `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User
- **Notes**: Keep ripple intensity subtle—aim for polish, not distraction

---

#### **Selected (Persistent State)**

- **Purpose**: Indicate ongoing selection, e.g., toggles in nav menus.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Left-to-right background fill** animation (100% width)
  - **The icon color** shifts to highlight (e.g., brand primary or white)
  - **Outline** thickens subtly or animates with a swirl
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quart`
- **Trigger**: User (tap or system state sync)
- **Notes**:
  - Pair with haptics or sound feedback on mobile if applicable

---

### 2. Sequencing

- Use in **horizontal nav bars**, **icon button clusters**, or **tool panels**
- Apply **staggered sequencing** on the mount:
  - Animate icon fill → outline draw → label (if present)
  - Delay per icon: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
  - Direction: left → right (LTR) or contextually

### 3. Easing Logic

| **Motion Type**      | **Easing**                       | **Purpose**                         |
| :------------------- | :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------- |
| Hover feedback       | `ease-out-quad`                  | Feels responsive and anticipatory   |
| Active ripple        | `ease-in-quad` → `ease-out-quad` | Sharp reaction \+ soft release      |
| Selection transition | `ease-in-out-quart`              | Smooth and intentional state change |
| Outline fade only    | `ease-none`                      | Neutral appearance change           |

---

### 4. Accessibility Considerations

- **Keyboard focus and selected states** must be distinguishable from hover
- Avoid relying on **color alone** to differentiate interaction states
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
  - Disable ripple and stroke swirl
  - Use instant fill changes and solid color transitions.
