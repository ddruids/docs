#### 1. **Motion States**

 **Idle → Active (Start)**

- **Purpose**: Indicate background activity or waiting state
- **Pattern**:
  - Spinner fades in
  - Begins continuous rotation
- **Duration**:
  - Fade in: `duration-short` (150ms)
  - Rotation: infinite loop, one rotation every 1000ms
- **Easing**:
  - Fade: `ease-out-quad`
  - Rotation: `ease-none` (linear constant speed)
- **Trigger**: System

**Active → Complete (End)**

- **Purpose**: Cleanly conclude the loading state
- **Pattern**:
  - Spinner fades out
  - Optionally scales down slightly as it exits
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-quad`
- **Trigger**: System

#### 2. **Interaction Semantics**

- **System-triggered**
- Always uses **linear easing** for rotation to signal mechanical, uninterrupted motion

---

#### 3. **Easing Logic**

- **Fade In**: `ease-out`
- **Fade Out**: `ease-in`
- **Rotation**: `ease-none` For smooth, continuous spin

---

#### 4. **Variants**

- **Inline Spinner** (used in buttons or small components)
  - Smaller size
  - Faster rotation (800ms per loop)
  - No entrance animation
- **Full Page Spinner**
  - Includes backdrop fade
  - May include text like “Loading...” with fade-in and staggered dots

---

#### 5. **Accessibility Considerations**

- Spinner should have `role="status"` with descriptive text hidden from view (e.g., “Loading…” for screen readers)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`Disable rotation and fallback to pulsing or blinking dot
