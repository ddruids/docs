### 1. Motion States

#### ðŸŸ¢ **Entrance (On Open)**

- **Purpose**: Visually introduce a system-level or user-initiated overlay while maintaining focus.
- **Pattern**:
  - Scale up from 95% to 100%
  - Fade in from 0% to 100%
  - Translate upward by 8â€“12px
- **Duration**: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quart`
- **Trigger**: System or user
- **Notes**:
  - Use **staggered sequencing** for modal children: title â†’ subtitle â†’ inputs â†’ buttons.
  - Entrance should feel deliberate and calm to reflect system authority.

#### ðŸ”´ **Exit (On Dismiss)**

- **Purpose**: Provide a clean and intuitive removal from view.
- **Pattern**:
  - Scale down to 95%
  - Fade out to 0%
  - Translate downward slightly (8â€“12px)
- **Duration**: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-quad`
- **Trigger**: User or system
- **Notes**:
  - Exit motion mirrors entrance to maintain consistency and avoid cognitive load.

#### âš« **Backdrop Animation**

- **Purpose**: Focus user attention by dimming the background.
- **Pattern**:
  - Fade in and out opacity only (no movement or scale)
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-none`
- **Trigger**: System
- **Notes**:
  - Keep neutral and low-distraction. Use pure linear animation for opacity.

### 2. Sequencing

- Apply **staggered sequencing** to child components within the modal container.
- Recommended order (with optional delays between 50â€“75ms):
  1. Title
  2. Subtitle/Description
  3. Input Fields (grouped)
  4. Primary and Secondary Actions

---

### 3. Responsive Behavior

- **Mobile Adaptation**:
  - Replace scale/center-based animation with slide-from-bottom.
  - **Entrance**:
    - Slide in vertically from off-screen
    - Easing: `ease-out-cubic`
    - Duration: `duration-slow` (400ms)
  - **Exit**:
    - Slide down off-screen
    - Easing: `ease-in-cubic`
    - Duration: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- Use full-width modal layout with rounded top corners for bottom sheets.

---

### 4. Accessibility Considerations

- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
  - Remove scale and translation
  - Use fade-only transitions for both modal and backdrop
- Trap keyboard focus within modal while open
- Provide motion alternatives where necessary (e.g., visible focus ring instead of animation)
