### 1. Motion States

#### ⚪ **Idle → Loading (Start)**

- **Purpose**: Provide immediate feedback that content is loading while preserving the layout structure.
- **Pattern**:
  - Placeholder block(s) **fade in**
  - A **shimmer animation** (gradient sweep) begins looping across the shape
- **Durations**:
  - **Fade in**: `duration-short` (150ms)
  - **Shimmer loop**: 1500ms continuous loop
- **Easing**:
  - **Fade**: `ease-out-quad`
  - **Shimmer**: `ease-none` (linear)
- **Trigger**: System (automatically rendered during async loading)

---

#### ⚪ **Loading → Content Ready (End)**

- **Purpose**: Seamlessly replace placeholders with real content without visual disruption.
- **Pattern**:
  - Ghost loader **fades out**
  - Real content **fades in**, optionally with slight scale-up (e.g. 95% → 100%)
- **Durations**:
  - **Ghost Exit**: `duration-short` (150ms), `ease-in-quad`
  - **Content Entry**: `duration-normal` (250ms), `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: System (triggered when data is fully loaded)

---

### 2. Sequencing

- Use **staggered sequencing** for placeholder lists or grids:
  - Delay between ghost item appearances: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
- Apply a **latency-aware reveal strategy**:
  - Primary/above-the-fold content fades in first
  - Remaining ghost elements fade out after the actual content is visible

### 3. Easing Logic

| **Element**     | **Easing**      | **Why**                              |
| :-------------- | :-------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| Ghost Fade In   | `ease-out-quad` | Feels lightweight and non-disruptive |
| Ghost Fade Out  | `ease-in-quad`  | Quick removal with subtle exit       |
| Content Fade In | `ease-out-quad` | Smooth transition from placeholder   |
| Shimmer Motion  | `ease-none`     | Constant-speed illusion of loading   |

---

### 4. Variants

| **Type**          | **Use Case**              | **Pattern**                                      |
| :---------------- | :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| Line Ghost        | Text content              | Horizontal shimmer or subtle pulse               |
| Block Ghost       | Cards, images, list items | Rectangular placeholders with left→right shimmer |
| Circular Ghost    | Avatars, thumbnails       | Radial or arc shimmer                            |
| Shimmer Direction | Contextual                | LTR (default), RTL-aware, or top→bottom          |

### 5. Accessibility Considerations

- Ghost loaders are **purely visual** and **should not be read by screen readers**
  - Add `aria-hidden="true"` to all skeleton elements
- Use `role="status"` or `aria-live="polite"` on parent containers to announce content loading status
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
  - **Disable shimmer** animation
  - Fallback to static placeholders with only fade transitions

---

### 6. Developer Notes

- Avoid long shimmer cycles (\>2s), which can feel sluggish
- Don't use shimmer as a progress bar; pair with loading indicators if exact feedback is required
