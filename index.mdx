## Motion Tokens

Reusable variables that define animation durations and easing curves for smooth, consistent UI transitions. We have motion tokens: Duration for Animation Speed and Acceleration Token for Easing Values.

#### Duration Tokens

Predefined time values that standardize animation speeds for UI motion.

| Token             | Value   | Description                                                                                    |
| :---------------- | :-----: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `duration-none`   | `0m`    | Used for instant changes with no visual transition, ideal for opacity or binary toggles.       |
| `duration-xshort` | `75ms`  | Fast, snappy feedback for microinteractions like icon hovers or small UI elements.             |
| `duration-short`  | `150ms` | Quick transitions for taps, toggles, or low-friction interactions.                             |
| `duration-normal` | `250ms` | Balanced motion for tooltips, toasts, and standard UI reveals that it feels smooth but subtle. |
| `duration-slow`   | `400ms` | Slower animations for larger elements or full-screen transitions add weight and clarity.       |
| `duration-xslow`  | `600ms` | Deliberate pacing for major state changes or emphasis, such as modals or page shifts.          |

#### Acceleration Tokens

Easing curves that control animation velocity are used to create smooth, natural transitions.

| **Token**           | **Cubic Bezier**                      | **Description**                                                                                 |

| `ease-out-quart`    | `cubic-bezier(.165, .84, .44, 1)`     | Snap finish, works well for pop-outs or micro feedback.                                         |
| `ease-out-quint`    | `cubic-bezier(.23, 1, .32, 1)`        | High-impact ease-out creates a satisfying end to animations.                                    |

### Semantic Guidelines

#### Animation Triggers

- **User-triggered**: Use `ease-out` for entrance, `ease-in` for exit
- **System-triggered**: Use `ease-in-out`

#### Motion by Property

- **Position/rotation**: `ease-in`, `ease-out`
- **Opacity/color**: `ease-none`
- **Mechanical/robotic**: `ease-none`

#### Size-Based Duration

- Small elements: `duration-xshort`, `short`
- Medium elements: `duration-normal`
- Large elements: `duration-slow`, `xslow`

#### Sequencing

- **Staggered**: Used for list reveals, search results
- **Serial**: Used for alert chains, guidance flows

### Motion States

#### Hover

- For feedback and reveal (e.g., token hover, cards)
- Patterns:
  - Scale hover (visible container)
  - Spotlight hover (1:1 elements)
  - Mouse-aware underline (tab text)

#### Focus

- For mobile/non-pointer users
- Emphasizes location and selection context

#### Active

- Assures completion of interaction (e.g., button click)
- Patterns: Ripple, mouse-aware fill, border swirl

#### Selected

- Indicates persistent selection
- Patterns: Left-to-right background fill, border swirl

### Checklist Before Shipping

- Used correct motion token (`duration-*`, `ease-*`)
- Triggers mapped to user/system events
- Fallbacks in place for reduced motion
- Interactions feel fast but not rushed
