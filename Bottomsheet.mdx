title: "Bottom Sheet"
description: "The bottom sheet is a mobile-first UI pattern that presents contextually relevant actions or content from the bottom of the screen without taking over the full view."
---

### 1. Motion States

#### ‚¨ÜÔ∏è **Entrance (On Open)**

- **Purpose**: Introduce an interactive panel smoothly, without disrupting the screen context.
- **Pattern**:
  - Sheet slides in vertically: `translateY(100%) ‚Üí 0`
  - Backdrop fades from 0% to 100% opacity
- **Duration**: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-out-cubic`
- **Trigger**: User (tap, button press, gesture)
- **Notes**: Use swipe-gesture responsiveness (e.g., friction-based drag) for high fluidity.

---

#### ‚¨áÔ∏è **Exit (On Dismiss)**

- **Purpose**: Remove the sheet without abruptness.
- **Pattern**:
  - Slide down: `translateY(0) ‚Üí 100%`
  - Backdrop fades out
- **Duration**: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-cubic`
- **Trigger**: User (swipe down, tap backdrop) or system (timeout, navigation)
- **Notes**: Match the entrance curve in reverse for perceptual consistency.

---

#### üé≠ **Backdrop Animation**

- **Purpose**: Dim surrounding content and focus attention on the sheet
- **Pattern**:
  - Fade in/out only (no transform)
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-none`
- **Notes**: Opacity-only transitions ensure non-distracting behavior

---

### 2. Interaction Semantics

- **Primary trigger**: User interaction (tap or swipe up from the screen bottom)
- **Secondary trigger**: System logic (confirmation flows, autofill prompts)
- **Dismissal methods**:
  - Swipe down
  - Tap outside (on backdrop)
  - ESC key (keyboard fallback)

---

### 3. Sequencing

- When displaying a list of items, use **staggered sequencing** to animate content in order.
- Recommended:
  - **Delay**: `duration-xshort` (75ms) between list elements
  - **Direction**: Top-down within the sheet body

### 4. Easing Logic Summary

| **Element**        | **Motion** | **Easing**       | **Purpose**                                  |
| :----------------- | :--------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Sheet entrance     | Slide-in   | `ease-out-cubic` | Immediate response to user trigger           |
| Sheet exit         | Slide-out  | `ease-in-cubic`  | Smooth and polished closure                  |
| Backdrop animation | Fade only  | `ease-none`      | Passive visual layer without motion emphasis |

### 5. Variants

- **Partial Sheet**:
  - Height: 30‚Äì50% of screen
  - Drag to expand to full height
  - Great for quick actions or confirmation flows
- **Full Sheet**:
  - Occupies 90‚Äì100% of vertical space
  - Ideal for complex tasks (forms, selection modals, keyboard usage)

---

### 6. Accessibility Considerations

- Trap keyboard focus within the sheet
- Allow ESC or an accessible dismissal button
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
  - Replace `translateY` motion with **fade-in/out only**
  - Keep sheet and backdrop transitions distinct but minimal
