### 1. Motion States

#### **Entrance (On Open)**

- **Purpose**: Introduce secondary UI without disrupting primary flow.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Slide in** horizontally (left → right or right → left, based on placement)
  - **Backdrop fades** to darken inactive areas
- **Duration**: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-out-quart`
- **Trigger**: User interaction (button, swipe gesture)
- **Notes**:
  - Combine transform and opacity for a smoother transition
  - Prevent background scroll on open

---

#### **Exit (On Close)**

- **Purpose**: Dismiss drawer without abrupt interruption.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Slide out** in the reverse direction
  - **Backdrop fades out**
- **Duration**: `duration-slow` (400ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-quart`
- **Trigger**: User (close button, swipe, backdrop click) or system (auto-dismiss)
- **Notes**: Reverse entrance timing and easing for visual consistency.

---

#### **Backdrop**

- **Pattern**: Pure opacity transition
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-none`
- **Notes**: Should not distract; serves only to focus attention on the drawer

---

### 2. Interaction Semantics

- **User-triggered** via click, swipe, or shortcut
- **Dismissal triggers**: tapping outside, pressing ESC, swipe-back gesture
- Matches **slide-in/slide-out** entrance and exit standards

---

### 3. Sequencing

- **Staggered sequencing** within the drawer content (e.g., wallet balances, filter controls):
  - Delay per item: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
  - Recommended flow: Top → Bottom or Left → Right
- **Latency-aware loading**:
  - Prioritize critical info (e.g,. balance, name) before less essential elements
  - Ghost loaders may animate first, followed by real content on load

### 4. Easing Logic

| **Element**   | **Easing**       | **Why**                                           |
| :------------ | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| Slide In      | `ease-out-quart` | Feels fast and responsive for direct user actions |
| Slide Out     | `ease-in-quart`  | Exit feels conclusive and deliberate              |
| Backdrop Fade | `ease-none`      | Passive background avoids the perception of lag   |

### 5. Accessibility Considerations

- **Focus trapping**: Ensure keyboard focus stays within the drawer when open
- **Dismissal**: ESC key should close the drawer; provide a close button
- **Reduced Motion**:
  - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
  - Replace slide with **fade-only** transitions for sensitive users
- Maintain **ARIA roles**:
  - Use `role="dialog"` or `role="complementary"` with `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`
