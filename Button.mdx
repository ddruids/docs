#### **1. Motion States**

#### ðŸ”¹ **Hover (Web Only)**

- **Purpose**: Provides visual feedback to indicate interactivity, enhancing user anticipation.
- **Pattern**:
  - _Mouse-aware fill_: The hover effect follows cursor entry, making the interaction feel personal and responsive.
  - _Subtle scale-up_: Slight button enlargement (e.g., 1.04x) to add depth without disruption.
- **Duration**: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User (pointer interaction)
- **Notes**: Should feel lightweight and fast. Avoid using on mobile where hover is unsupported.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Focus (Mobile & Keyboard Navigation)**

- **Purpose**: Enhances accessibility by indicating which element has keyboard or screen-reader focus.
- **Pattern**:
  - _Outline glow_ or _bounce highlight_: A ring or border subtly animates into view or pulses.
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User (tab or focus via accessibility tools)
- **Notes**: Must be perceivable under all conditions. Focus state complements, not replaces, hover state.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Active (On Click / Tap)**

- **Purpose**: Confirms interaction and initiates an action with tactile feedback.
- **Pattern**:
  - _Ripple effect_ radiating from tap/click origin (material style)
  - _Border swirl_ or color fill to simulate physical activation
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**:
  - _Press-in_: `ease-in-quad`
  - _Release-out_: `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User (click or tap)
- **Notes**: This state completes the transition, which started with hover/focus. If supported, combine with sound or haptics on mobile.

#### ðŸ”¹ **Selected (Persistent or Toggle Buttons)**

- **Purpose**: Indicates an active or toggled state when a button remains selected among others (e.g., filters, tab controls).
- **Pattern**:
  - _Left-to-right background fill_ animation
  - _Optional border swirl_ or icon shift to reinforce selection
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User
- **Notes**: Use this state only where selection persists after interaction (e.g., toggle switches, filters, mode selectors).

### 2. Sequencing

- **Single Buttons**: No sequencing applied.
- **Grouped Buttons** (e.g., segmented controls, toolbars):
  - Use **staggered sequencing** with `duration-xshort` delay steps (50â€“75ms between siblings).
  - Entrance: Left to right (LTR languages), top to bottom on vertical stacks.

### 3. Accessibility Considerations

- **Focus Visibility**: Ensure focus styles are always visible, even when animations are reduced or disabled.
- **Reduced Motion Support**:
  - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
  - Replace scale, ripple, or transforms with static state changes (e.g., color only).
- **Contrast & Feedback**: All motion states must always retain sufficient contrast and legibility.
