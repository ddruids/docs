#### **Motion States**

**Hover (Web only)**

- **Purpose**: Feedback and anticipation
- **Pattern**: Mouse-aware fill or subtle scale-up
- **Duration**: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User
- **Notes**: Creates a sense of interactivity without distraction

**Focus (Mobile & keyboard nav)**

- **Purpose**: Accessibility; indicates current focus
- **Pattern**: Outline or bounce highlight
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User (non-pointer)

**Active (On Click / Tap)**

- **Purpose**: Assures user action is being taken
- **Pattern**: Ripple effect or border swirl
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-quad` for press, `ease-out-quad` for release
- **Trigger**: User
- **Notes**: Completes hover motion and initiates transition

**Selected (For toggle buttons or persistent states)**

- **Purpose**: Indicate the button is selected among other states
- **Pattern**: Background fill animation (left-to-right), optional border swirl
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User
- **Notes**: Use only if the button maintains an ongoing selected state

#### 2. **Sequencing**

- Not used for single buttons.
- Use **staggered sequencing** when buttons are part of a group (e.g., segmented controls, toolbars).

---

#### 3. **Accessibility Considerations**

- Ensure focus animations are visible under reduced motion settings.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and offer fallback states.
