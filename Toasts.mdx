### 1. Motion States

#### **Entrance (On Appear)**

- **Purpose**: Introduce a subtly emphasized toast, drawing attention without stealing focus.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Slide in** from the screen’s bottom (mobile) or top/right edge (desktop)
  - Simultaneous **fade-in** from 0% to 100% opacity
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-out-cubic`
- **Trigger**: System event (e.g., form success, background process complete)
- **Notes**:
  - Avoid bouncing or overshooting, the oast should feel smooth, not demanding
  - Can optionally include a **micro pulse** for success messages

---

#### **Exit (Auto-dismiss or Manual Close)**

- **Purpose**: Remove toast cleanly from view, either automatically or on user dismissal.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Slide out** in the same direction as the entrance
  - **Fade out** to 0% opacity
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-quad`
- **Trigger**: System timeout (e.g., 5 seconds) or manual user action (click 'x')
- **Notes**: Maintain consistency between the entrance and exit direction

---

### 2. Interaction Semantics

- Triggered by **system events** (status changes, confirmations, errors)
- Categorized under **standard UI animation** (not direct manipulation)
- Does **not trap focus**, but must be screen-reader detectable (`aria-live`)

---

### 3. Sequencing

- **Serial sequencing**:
  - Used when multiple toasts are queued or stacked
  - Apply entry delay: `duration-xshort` (75ms) between items
- **Staggered exit**:
  - Used when multiple toasts are dismissed in sequence (e.g., undo stack or bulk actions)
  - Reverse order preferred for clarity

### 4. Easing Logic

| **Motion Type** | **Easing Token**    | **Purpose**                              |
| :-------------- | :------------------ | :--------------------------------------- |
| Toast Entrance  | `ease-in-out-cubic` | Balanced motion; smooth reveal           |
| Toast Exit      | `ease-in-quad`      | Subtle and quick dismissal               |
| Opacity-only    | `ease-none`         | Used if the slide is disabled (fallback) |

---

### 5. Urgency & Emphasis Patterns

Toasts can include **semantic urgency cues**:

- **Success**:
  - Light **pulse ring** or scale-in pop on icon
  - Green accent animation using `ease-out-quad`
- **Error**:
  - **Brief horizontal shake** (4–6px) using `ease-in-cubic`
  - Red glow pulse if persistent
- **Info/Warning**:
  - Subtle background tint or icon fill shift, no animation emphasis

> These micro animations should only be used if content is visible for more than 2 seconds and motion is enabled.

---

### 6. Accessibility Considerations

- Toasts must:
  - Use `aria-live="polite"` or `assertive` Depending on criticality
  - Be **dismissible** and **time-bound**
  - Be **keyboard dismissible** (focusable close button or ESC key)
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:
  - **Disable slide and shake**
  - Use **fade only** as motion fallback.
