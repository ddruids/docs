title: "Tooltip"
description: "Tooltips provide lightweight contextual assistance or labels. They appear temporarily on hover or focus and should remain subtle, fast, and non-intrusive."
mode: "wide"

### 1. Motion States

#### **Entrance (On Hover or Focus)**

- **Purpose**: Gently reveal additional context without breaking the user’s flow.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Fade in** from 0% to 100% opacity
  - **Slight upward motion** (e.g., translateY: 4–6px → 0)
- **Duration**: `duration-normal` (250ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-out-quad`
- **Trigger**: User
  - **Hover** on desktop
  - **Focus** on mobile or keyboard navigation
- **Notes**:
  - Motion must feel quick and seamless
  - Position motion is subtle—avoid bouncing or scaling

---

#### **Exit (On Hover Out or Blur)**

- **Purpose**: Cleanly remove the tooltip without jarring the user.
- **Pattern**:
  - **Fade out** from 100% to 0% opacity
  - **Slight downward motion** (e.g. translateY: 0 → 4–6px)
- **Duration**: `duration-short` (150ms)
- **Easing**: `ease-in-quad`
- **Trigger**: User unhovers or an element loses focus
- **Notes**:
  - Keep exit motion fast, especially if the tooltip appears frequently.

### 2. Interaction Semantics

| **Trigger Type** | **Pattern**  | **Use Case**                     |
| :--------------- | :----------- | :------------------------------- |
| Hover            | Reveal Hover | Desktop mouse input              |
| Focus            | Reveal Focus | Mobile or keyboard accessibility |

- Tooltip motion is classified under **reveal patterns**
- Must remain **non-blocking**, **non-modal**, and dismissible on blur

---

### 3. Sequencing

- **Single tooltip**: No sequencing required
- **Bulk tooltips** (e.g., grid labels, tag clouds):
  - Use **staggered sequencing** for the initial reveal
  - Delay per tooltip: `duration-xshort` (75ms)
  - Animate in directional flow (e.g., left → right, top → bottom)

### 4. Easing Logic

| **Motion Element**    | **Easing Token** | **Reason**                                   |
| :-------------------- | :--------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Tooltip Entrance      | `ease-out-quad`  | Feels fast, responsive, non-blocking         |
| Tooltip Exit          | `ease-in-quad`   | Closes neatly and with finality              |
| Fade only (no motion) | `ease-none`      | Used in reduced motion or low-emphasis cases |

---

### 5. Accessibility Considerations

- **Focus Accessibility**:
  - Ensure tooltips appear on keyboard focus (`:focus-visible`)
  - Do not rely on hover-only interactions
- **Reduced Motion**:
  - Honor `prefers-reduced-motion`
    - Disable translation
    - Use **opacity fade only**
- Tooltip must not trap focus or interfere with screen reader flow
- Add `role="tooltip"` and ensure correct `aria-describedby` relationship with the triggering element
